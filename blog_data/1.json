In the peaceful Shire, where days are spent tending gardens and enjoying hearty breakfasts, lived Bilbo Baggins — a hobbit who never imagined he would become a legend. His life was all about comfort, afternoon tea, and avoiding anything out of the ordinary. But everything changed one morning when a wizard named Gandalf knocked on his door. An Unexpected Journey Bilbo never sought adventure; in fact, he ran from it. However, the visit from Gandalf and thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield pulled him into a perilous quest: to reclaim a treasure guarded by the fearsome dragon Smaug.

In the depths of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo stumbled upon more than just danger: a mysterious ring that granted him invisibility. Unbeknownst to him, that small trinket would go on to shape the fate of Middle-earth forever.",
