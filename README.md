# Personal-Blog
Personal blog to write and publish articles on various topics.


### How to run the code
First make sure you have flask installed on a virtual enviroment `(requirements.txt)`.

In case 'USERS.json' is fully empty, just add an empty dict `{}` to avoid errors.
Also, 'USERS.json' must be out of the directory `blog_data`.
There's a lot more to implement and improve on the app but I'll leave it like this for now.

### Admin
To enter to the app as an admin, if not signed up, sign up as `admin` with password `chocolate`.
Any other names and passwords to sign up as a normal user. (first sign up, then log in)
